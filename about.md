Hello!

I'm a software developer from Boston, USA. I'm currently pursuing master's degree in [Information Systems](https://www.coe.neu.edu/degrees/ms-is#_ga=1.135051256.869583083.1460757840) at [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/ "University Homepage").

Throughout my education I've had experience working with software to build useful applications. I love learning new frameworks and technologies and I've developed software for a variety of different usecases. I always find myself being drawn to building applications which are driven by a purpose, to solve real world problems. I believe in creating software with empathy.

This site doubles as my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/resume "Sreeram's Resume") and a place to post anything I find interesting, my blog of sorts.

Please feel free to <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">email</a> me if you have any questions or comments.
